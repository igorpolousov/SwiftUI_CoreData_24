## 3. Determining and adding(creating) basic reusable elements: Fonts, Colors etc.
- Creating Folder - Assets
- Creating file for Themes in Assets - share fonts and colors throughout app - it can be Class or Enum: final class - can read properties, but no changes and inheritance

### For creating any new module in app better to create and use other branch in GIT and after success completion make a merge
